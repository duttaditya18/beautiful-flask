They are a way of expressing our feelings in a wonderful way.Words are absolutely beautiful. Some words offend some people. Some words compress the meanings and bind us from thinking more than that. Manly and girly. What do these words even mean? According to our society, 'girly' means being like a girl and manly means 'brave' or 'strong and suitable for a man. Wow! Amazing! If girly means being a girl then why can't manly mean being a man? Why does manly have to be "brave or strong"? Why can't girly be the same then? Girly means being a girl but then also the society has created certain rules for being a girl. For being a girl, stay pretty, speak softly and s=know cooking. Why society? Why can't girls re-invent them? Why can't it be normal if girls are brave and strong? Why can't girls chop their hairs off? A girl can't have tattoos. A girl can be "manly". The girl who has chopped their hair, has muscles, has tattoos, is strong, brave and bold. And please, let them be like that! Men, they can be feminine, they can be concerned about their looks, about their attire, they can pierce their ears, they can grow their hair, let them! Be people what they what to be, let them be what they want to be. Redefine these words, these definitions. Give us freedom! Please! Let us live the way we want to.</p></div>
